# üí≥ FlexyGo - Multi-Currency Digital Wallet
**FlexyGo** is an innovative financial application designed to simplify cross-border transactions. Developed as a project for a Human-Computer Interaction course, this application allows users to top-up their balance in Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) and convert it into various foreign currencies based on real-time market rates.

The project addresses the challenges users face with complex currency conversions, high fees, and the inconvenience of carrying cash while traveling.
